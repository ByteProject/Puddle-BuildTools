Have you ever dreamed about a journey far beyond the known regions of the universe? Close to Alpha Centauri, Olivia Lund is on the trail of one of mankind's greatest secrets and a thousand-year-old mystery. After nearly 20 years in hypersleep, she wakes up alone on her stranded ship, the Polaris-7. The artificial intelligence Io seems to be her only remaining friend now.

Hibernated 1 - This Place is Death (Director's Cut) is an Infocom style interactive fiction game. It's a complete rewrite of the classic, award-winning Hibernated game using Infocom's Z-machine standard, with tons of additional narrative content and riddles. If Infocom had been asked to recreate the classic Hibernated, the Director's Cut would have been the outcome.

SYSTEMS
The game is available for Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and PCW, Spectrum +3, Spectrum Next, Commodore Amiga, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Apple 2, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Commodore 128, Mega 65, MSX 1 and MSX 2, Oric, Commodore Plus/4, TI99/4a, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore PET, SAM Coupé, classic Macintosh and modern PC. In addition, there are z3 and z5 files provided, for playing the game in your Z-machine interpreter of choice. 

PHYSICAL RELEASE
There's a physical release available and it comes in a box that resembles the original Infocom packaging back from the day. It can be ordered from my publisher Poly.Play: https://bit.ly/34NFaeX

DONATIONS
This interactive story is the result from many moons of hard work, so any donation is much appreciated. In case you've already paid for the original game and now, after playing the Director's Cut, you somehow feel the urge to thank me a second time, you may also buy me a coffee: http://ko-fi.com/8bitgames

TEXT ADVENTURES IN THE MODERN ERA
Hibernated 1 Director's Cut is following the path of some of the most iconic interactive fiction releases from the 80s and early 90s, trying to resemble a retro look and feel but it also aims to meet modern era expectations. There are no dead ends and the diffculty level is moderate. Generally it's more about experiencing a story rather than drowning the player in frustration.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
You'll find a PlayIF card in this archive which also has been printed on a postcard for the physical release. This is your introduction to interactive fiction gameplay. The game makes use of a few additional verbs but it is very verbose in telling you what these are and how they are applied correctly. When the game starts, you are prompted to type HELP. Please do so at least once to learn about the specific game mechanics.

The game is compatible with the BBC Model B, BBC Model B+ and BBC Master 128 computers. It will run without sideways RAM, albeit slowly. Having at least 16K of sideways RAM or a 6502 second processor is recommended. Shadow RAM will make things even smoother. The game also runs on Acorn Electron computers, provided you have at least 16K of sideways RAM, which is a requirement. On the Elk, I recommend playing it with an ElkSD64, as with this device you won't need to worry about anything. Your Elk will thank you later. We all love the Elk!

Commodore 128:

The game is compatible with the TI-99/4A and Geneve 9640 computers. The minimum requirements for TI-99/4A are: 32K, Disk controller, and Extended BASIC cartridge. 80 column mode requires either an F18A or V9938 hardware enhancement.
For the Geneve 9640 you need TIMODE (GPL) and the Extended BASIC cartridge files. You may use either the 40 column or V9938/58 option.

Commodore VIC-20
Insert the game disk
Type LOAD"GAME-VIC",8,1
when the computer finished loading type RUN

The game needs at least 28k of RAM, even better if you have a modern cartridge like the Penultimate Cart from The Future was 8-bit. The Penultimate Cart provides 35k of RAM for your VIC and makes the game run significantly faster than with 28k. You really need to be patient with 28k.

Commodore PET
Insert the game disk
Type LOAD"GAME-PET",8,1
when the computer finished loading type RUN

The game will fine on any PET with at least 32k but needless to say the more RAM you have the better the game will perform.

Modern PC:
Open the index.html file with a contemporary browser of choice
This version supports the UNDO command

Z-machine files (.z3 & .z5):
For use with your interpreter of choice, Frotz or Lectrote are favorable. I recommend using the z5 file when playing in a modern environment. The z5 version supports the UNDO command.

CREDITS
This game has been written using Graham Nelson's Inform 6 language, words can hardly express his gift to the community. It uses PunyInform, an alternate library by Fredrik Ramsberg and Johan Berntsson, optimized for classic 8-bit and 16-bit targets. Without the hard work and support of these individuals, none of this would have ever been possible. I'd also like to thank Infocom for being a constant inspiration since my youth and for creating the Z-machine standard, allowing us to still honor their heritage so many years after they disbanded. I played many Infocom games on my beloved Commodore Amiga and now after more than 30 years I can neither forget nor let go. My deepest appreciation goes to Andrew Plotkin, whether it's for his work on the PlayIF card that comes with this game, the MaxZip interpreter that's been used for the classic Macintosh version or for helping us with feature requests and bugfixes on the current Inform compiler. Without any doubt he is one of the most vibrant personalities of the interactive fiction scene and I am glad he is around. Please also type CREDITS in game for wise words, dedications and the beta crew. Special thanks to Martin aka Logiker for the PETSCII directory art on the C64 and Plus/4 version of the game, the legendary Facet who contributed the loading screen on Commodore 64, Dylan Barry aka Rail/Slave who created the CPC loading screen, Vanja Utne aka Mermaid for the ZX Spectrum and MSX artworks, Ralph Niese for the box art and 16-bit intro screens, my friend Uto for the MSX loader, Ingo Hinterding aka AWSM for the C64 IRQ loader code, my buddy Christian Simpson aka Perfractic for all his support on his channel, again Fredrik and Johan for their amazing Ozmoo interpreter that is used for the C64, C128 and Plus/4 versions of this game, Edilbert Kirk for sharing his code and allowing me to use his VIC-20 and PET Z-machine interpreters, Steve Flintham for his outstanding work in porting Ozmoo to the BBC and the Elk, the one and only George Beckett for all his knowledge which resulted in the two of us hacking together a working and well performing Z-machine v3 interpreter for the Scinclair ZX Spectrum +3, for his incredible work with ZXLDR on the CP/M Plus .SCR renderer and of course for connecting me to the copyright holder of Locomotive CP/M Plus, allowing us to bundle it with the game, Dannii Willis aka CuriousDannii for his work on Parchment, the IF interpreter for the web that is used for modern PC version of this game, Hugo Labrande for his abbreviations optimization script, also for being the first person who tested my Puny buildtools suite and of course for the great, ongoing and fruitful conversation we have regarding interactive fiction, Linus Åkesson for his review of the original Hibernated in 2018 which helped me understand how much really could be done to improve the gaming experience for the player, and I have to admit it took me quite some time to overcome my ego and appreciate the useful feedback he provided back then, ultimately resulting in the game being rewritten as a Director's Cut, so thank you from the bottom of my heart Linus, in that context I also need to thank Marco Innocenti, for his encouraging words that helped me to stay on the path I've taken, Tim Gilberts for being my mentor since day one, and who else can say he has one of the true adventure legends as his mentor, Chris Ainsely, the man behind Adventuron with whom I have a wonderful exchange of thoughts, always inspiring and always restless, thanks to Mark James Hardisty, who creates and publishes the wonderful The Classic Adventurer bookazine, he's been a vibrant catalyst of my work, Juan J. Martínez for the CPC loader code and the dumpal utility, Chris Pile for his work on Pro-DOS, Pere for his work on the Dragon64 implementation, TI99 legend Barry Boone for allowing us to use his Z-machine interpreter and InsaneMultitasker for his amazing support in providing a sanitized TI99 image as well as F18A compatibility, the great Stuart Williams who granted me the legendary Crash Smash award for the game's first incarnation, wherever you are, I miss our conversations but I look forward meeting you again at the end of time. If I have forgotten you know in this hailstorm of appreciation, believe me when I say it didn't happen intentionally. Approach me and I'll make sure to add you to this manifesto here in the hall of giants.
