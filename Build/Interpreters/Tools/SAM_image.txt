
Making a SAM Screen
-------------------

The SAM Coupe screen is 256 x 192 pixels in size. It contains 16 colours in total, from a palette of 128.

To create the SAM Screen you can either resize your original to the correct size, or use the disk management utility to rescale.
You will however get better results working from a resized original screen.

Once you have created your image, which can be in most standard filetypes (PNG, GIF, JPG) - please load in the SAM Coupe Advanced Disk Manager utility (see below for link).  This utility allows you to do various options on SAM Disk files. However, we are just using this for the picture conversion feature.

The utility will start up with a dummy SAM disk image to work with. The picture you have created will be saved on this for now.

Select the FILE menu. At the bottom of this menu, select IMPORT PICTURE.

Select your image you have previously prepared.

If the image is already at the correct size, select Resize to 100%. Please ensure MODE 4 is selected.
If you wish to attempt to rescale a larger image, try the various options for resize until you find a suitable one. You can manually enter a percentage value if required.

Once this is done, select "Save As" and enter a short name, then close back to the main editor screen.
The picture will now appear on the Disk image under the new name.

Save this disk image now, using IMAGE  + SAVE IMAGE 1 as... and give this a suitable name and location.


Final stage of conversion
-------------------------

After creating the image, we need to split this into two suitable files for the loader system to use.
This is the PAL file (palette) and the SCREEN file (the screen data).

We'll do this using the SIMCoupe emulator for a few simple steps:

* Load SimCoupe 
* Use FILE menu, and Open the DSK image saved from SCADM.
* An error message "101 no AUTO* file, 0:1" will appear
* Your picture should be the first file on the "DSK" you have inserted. To check this, type DIR 1 (return) for the directory. Please make a note of the filename.
* If you wish to load your picture to check it, you can type LOAD 1 (return) at this point.

* To convert the picture:
* Type LOAD "(filename)" CODE 32768
* Use file menu, and use EXPORT. From BASIC address 32768, length of 24756 bytes. Save as filename SCREEN (no extention)
* Use file menu, and use EXPORT. From BASIC 57344, length of 16 bytes. Save as filename PAL (no extention)

And that's all that's required,
